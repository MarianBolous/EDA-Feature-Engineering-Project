# Startup Success Prediction: Data Analysis & Machine Learning  

Exploring What Makes a Startup Successful



## Overview 

This project explores startup success prediction using data science and machine learning.  

By analyzing funding rounds, founder count, investor influence, and startup descriptions (NLP), we extract key insights into what contributes to startup success or failure.

🔍 Key Areas of Analysis:  
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✔️ Funding Trends (Location, Categories, Rounds)  
✔️ Founder & Team Composition  
✔️ Investor Influence on Success  
✔️ Natural Language Processing (NLP) on Startup Descriptions  
✔️ Predictive Modeling for Success

## Data Story & Key Insights

### Funding & Location Trends  
- California dominates** startup funding, followed by New York & Massachusetts.  
- Massachusetts startups receive the highest average funding per round.  

### Startup Age & Success  
- Startups that raise funding sooner tend to survive longer**.  
- Those that struggle to raise capital for years often fail faster.  

### Founder Count & Success 
- Startups with 2-3 founders have the highest chances of survival.  
- Single-founder startups struggle, while teams of 5+ founders show mixed success.  

### Investor Influence 
- Well-connected investors (who invested in successful startups) increase survival odds.  
- Some investors are strongly linked to failed startups, indicating risky investments.  

### NLP Analysis on Startup Descriptions

- Topic Modeling grouped startups into 5 main themes, such as Cloud Computing, AI, Marketplaces, & Enterprise SaaS.  

- High-frequency words in successful startups: "platform," "user," "solution," "technology."  

- Failed startups tend to use "idea," "market," "product," suggesting less traction-driven focus.
